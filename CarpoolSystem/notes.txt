I refactored:
CRUD -> DatabaseConnection
UI -> SystemPrompt

DBA and most of UI methods are no longer needed.

I created PersistentObject interface that
-gets CRUD SQL statements for concrete objects
-parses ResultSet data when retrieving from the database.
-manages the I/O between users and the object's data

I added 'implements PersistentObject' to all of the object classes that are stored in the database.

Now things will be cleaner, but we have to rework all of the use cases.
Only the Manage Account use case works so far.

I used code from DBA and UI to implement the interface methods in Commuter.java so it is mostly implemented, but somethings need to be done differently know.
